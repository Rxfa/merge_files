# FMS - File Merge Script
Small script written in python whose goal is to merge as many files as wanted into one.

The idea for this script came after I had to merge a few texts files of subdomains of a web app, and wasn't feeling like spending a few minutes(or hours) checking for duplicates, so why not spend twice that time writing a script that will make the process 10x faster in the future?
