# FMS - File Merge Script
Merge as many text files as you want.

The idea for this script came after I had to merge a few text files of a web app subdomains and wasn't feeling like spending a few minutes(or hours) checking for duplicates, so why not spend some time writing a script that will make the process much, much faster in the future?
